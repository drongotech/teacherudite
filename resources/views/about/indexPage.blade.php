                        Byron who is one of the founders of Teach Erudite is an 
                        entrepreneur who started his first business at the age of fifteen years. 
                        When reaching his early twenties, Byron worked in the skills development 
                        sector in South Africa, specialising in educational programs for people with 
                        disabilities, using the opportunity to learn about human resources, skills, 
                        education, recruiting and executive sales. During the course of working in the 
                        skills development sector, Byron and Msimelelo identified that the youth 
                        unemployment problem in South Africa had no immediate solutions. 
                        This created an opportunity for them to seek opportunities for 
                        employment for young South African people abroad. Teach Erudite was 
                        born 3 years ago and began sending graduates to China. Since then, 
                        Teach Erudite has expanded into partnerships with private schools in UAE, 
                        Oman, China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, Singapore and Mongolia. 
                        Byron has a true passion for trading in the international space for commerce, 
                        sales, mapping out business strategy and entrepreneurship.
